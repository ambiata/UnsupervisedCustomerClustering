# Ambiata Blog Entry - Unsupervised Customer Segmentation with Knowledge Graph Embeddings
This is the code for mimicking the paper <i>Unsupervised Customer
Segmentation with Knowledge Graph Embeddings by Sumit Pai et al</i>. The paper experiments with using
graphs of customers purchasing and reviewing consumable products.
This blog focuses on two data sources. [Rate Beer](https://www.ratebeer.com/api.asp) and
[My Anime List](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist)

Rate Beer has the reviews on beer consumed by a reviewers and is available by registering for the
api and downloading the Stanford created file that is zipped and immediately
available for use.
My Anime List contains the reviews of Anime customers, as well as what episode they
have watched which this blog attempts to show this can be treated as a consumable
product.
