review/text: On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.

review/text: On tap at the John Harvards in Springfield PA.  Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing.  Aroma of orange and various other citrus.  A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe.  Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance.  Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBUs they said this one had.

Aroma was lightly sweet and malty, really no hop presence.  Flavor was light, grainy, grassy and malty.  Just really light in flavor and aroma overall. Watery.

Lively yet thin and watery body. Oh yeah, the person seating me told me this was a new one and was a Pale Ale even though the menu he gave me listed it as a lighter beer brewed in the Kolsh style.

The bartender told me this was an imperial stout at about 8%.  She didn't convince me, there was no alcohol to be found, and it was sweet as hell!  But still good.

Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). Ill stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel.	 Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard clean up.

Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, clove, banana, and cherries, with light roastiness.  Aroma was very dubbelish.  Herbal taste of dark fruits, yeast and alcohol was barely noticed.  Slick mouthfeel.  Could have been more flavorful.

review/text: UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Darkish copper colored, with no head -	probably poured like that on purpose.	Served inappropriately at about 40 deg	F.  This beer was cold.  It tasted	fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up 	for awhile.  It was worth the wait, as a	very interesting and complex character developed.	Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of	bubblegum.  Also a little clove or some kind of 	spice.  Strong but not overwhelming at all.  Surpisingly	easy to drink.

Slight smokey flavor with a bourbon taste in the initial sip. Flavors of malt, vanilla and hops still remain although none dominate the brew. Taste is still very enjoyable with a smooth and balanced finish.

Aroma of sweet toasty pale malt and sweet light fruitiness with a good resiny piny hop character.  Body starts with decent fullness and sweet caramel malts with good balance of hop flavor and bitterness.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet, nicely aged and balanced.

review/text: UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 On tap. Interesting experiment, but I liked regular Hopula better. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is slightly wood and hops, but mostly bourbon. Flavor is everything I loved about Hopula, but with too much booze. Some nice vanilla notes, but bourbon constantly overpowers the Hopula. Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels.

Flavor is strong bourbon, too strong.  The base beer is hidden under there somewhere but is way overpowered.  I had trouble getting it down to be honest.

review/text: Cask at GTMW.  Poured coppery-amber with a loose cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.

review/text: On tap at Noblesville brewery - Aroma is pungent with lots of brett and oak.  Flavor brings forward some toasted malts but quickly falls back to doughy yeast, oak and brett giving it a nice funky sour finish.  Palate is tart and creamy.  A fantastic sour that would draw some attention if it got out of the brewery.

Aroma is nutty, with cherries and a tartness to it. Very earthy. Flavor is nice and sour, lots of red fruits and nuts, with just a hint of yeast. The wood really comes into play here, and works nicely with the other elements. This one is tasty for sure.

review/text: Had this on tap last night at new Barley Island, broad ripple location. Pours medium brown with light tan head that fades. Nose is sweet brown malt and slightly sour brett. Taste is smooth, clean brown style malt with a perfectly balanced sour profile bringing in the brett flavor. I was skeptical of the at first, but it came out quite nicely IMHO. On the lighter side in terms of sour intensity, but the overall taste is very pleasant.

review/text: Bottle and served in my big old Tripel Karmeliet glass: Deep brown and has a mostly lasting frothy bubbles with spotty lace. The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first.

review/text: This pours a clear chestnut body with a slender beige ring in place of a head.  No lacing.  The aroma is lightly roasted malt, faint floral scents, dark brown sugar, and licorice.  All remain in the flavor, which is a bit thin, the body being somewhat watery, with the addition of a soft dark fruitiness.  The aftertaste is one of licorice, not overbearing and annoying, but subtle.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Liquors, Porter, IN<font size=-1>

review/text: Poured into a snifter. Sinister Minister pours an extremely rich mahogany, with a slightly tan head, with a low retention rate, which leads to decent lacing. Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles. Crisp, clean and smooth mouthfeel. Not as carbonated which is nice. Very good drinkability. This is the first pro-am I have had, and it is a great one to start with.

review/text: 22 oz botle.  Pours a clear chestnut brown body with a small fizzy light brown head.  The nose is nutty and yeasty, with some light coffee and dark fruits.  Lots of Belgian yeast character here in the flavor.  Some dark fruits, heavy yeast, a little coffee on the back end, and finishes off with a bit of peppery alcohol.  Medium bodied with a somewhat watery texture and fizzy carbonation.  I wish that this were a little softer and rounder feeling.  OK beer, but nothing great.

Flavor is a little weaker than expected but what is there is quite good.  Dark roasted grains, more cocoa, pasty malts, some burnt biscuits and an underlying tartness.  Little bit dry on the palate.  Light alcohol presence and warming.  Finishes roasty and malty.  A decent Belgian Ale.  Thanks to **** for this one.

review/text: 2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009	An average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.

review/text: 22 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with garnet highlights and a medium sized beige head.  The aroma has moderate sweetness, yeast, a mix of fruits, and lightly spicy.  The flavor had bready malts, slightly fruity, dusty, yeast, but there seems to be something wrong.  I wasnt sure how old this was, but it appears as if this is in a downward spiral.  Medium bodied.  I should try this again when I know its fresher.

review/text: 22oz bottle from StFun. Thanks, Josh. Nice brown pour, with some glinting red in the appearance and a lively carbonation. The nose was rich and very fruity, and this more or less characterizes the taste as well. I was expecting something with more bitterness, and some roasted flavors. This actually comes across far more like a dubbel than anything else, though certainly an enjoyable one. Lively mouthfeel, tasty blend of ripe dark fruits and malts, long finish. Tasty beer.

review/text: Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.

The fruity, estery aroma provides notations of chocolate and banana. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Perfectly balanced, but theres just not much going on. Finishes bland and watery. Its not my cup of tea, but thanks to SoLan for providing the bottle of beer!

review/text: Bomber courtesy of StFun.  Pours a clear dark reddish brown with minimal head.  Nose is light coffee, mild cocoa, roasted barley and smoke.  Taste is pretty much like the aroma, except theres a dark fruitiness right as you take a sip.  Lighter, prickly mouth feel.  Not bad  thanks Josh!

review/text: Dark amber color out of the bottle with a fizzy beige head that left quickly.  Thin, watery sweet nose.  Not a lot of character in here, but nothing really offensive.  Thin caramel sweetness, some roasted grains and faint chocolate.  Kind of boring.

review/text: UPDATED: MAY 8, 2009 Richmond Summer Gathering. Bomber courtesy of jcwattsrugger. Clear, deep brown with a thin, ringed tan head. Mild coffee and chocolate nose, yeasty, seemed a bit infected to me, with some sour nut notes. Didnt really seem to crop up in the flavor. OK - Id like to get another one of these and re-rate.		Re-rate, Daytona 500 tasting. 750 from DragonStout, IIRC. Much better this go-round, none of the sour nut I noted before. Rate reflects this bottle.

review/text: Courtesy SoLan.  Pours dark brown, with a small off white head.  Smells a bit Belgian, some candy sugar, dark malts, and molasses make up the nose.  The flavor consists of some spices and a sweet malty presence.  Got a bit of graham cracker and caramel in there as well.  Kind of uniqu, but wasnt really getting me too exicted.  Certainly drinkable, but lacking a bit of something.

review/text: Bomber from Crown.  Herbal nose with heather and some tire air.  Pours the deep brown of a porter, with a short light brown head.  Taste is dry and roasty but still has those herbal notes (which endure into the aftertaste, where they approach juniper and give a slightly chalky residue) and flashes of fruity sweetness.  Dark chocolate, loads of anise, licorice, but very little of the latter.  Body is watery and a bit foamy, slightly tangy but without acidity.  Refreshing and dangerously easy to drink!  Smooth and subtle, a good bridge between new and old, one of the more interesting finds of this year!

review/text: Sampled at Noog4.  Dark Chestnut pour with a light head.  Bright and bubbly aroma with Belgian funk and a touch of roasted grain.  Nice.  Very drinkable.  Its light with a well balanced combination of grain, hay, funk, and roasted grain.  Carbonated to the point that it exaggerates its refreshing properties.  Light-medium body.  This is an easy drinker.

A medium to light bodied Belgian Ale. The malts are chocolate and toffee. The hops are earthy. Lots of flavors going on here, some roasted malts and some smoke as well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.

review/text: Bottle picked up in South Bend; poured a rich, dark brown with a small to medium off white head.  Aroma of dark fruit, banana, yeast, roasted malt and chocolate.  Was pretty thin and a bit watery.  Flavor reminded me of a black lager, with some spice, nuts and a general earthiness.  Easily drinkable, but it just didnt come together that well.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bottle and served in a tulip.  This beer poured an almost black with some mahogany highlights and a one-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly faded into a thin cap.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, dark fruits, and some earthy, fruity yeast esthers as well.  The flavor of the beer consisted of spicy yeast, chocolate, plums, raisins, and a hint of smoke.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Not bad.

review/text: From MI2CA, thanks for going through all the effort to find this for me, a trade that was months in the making.  Pours a dark brown, almost black color.   Aroma is what I was hoping for, new and different.  There is an orange/licorice spice coming out, not sure what it is but its but its not overbearing, just there.   Taste is light dark biscuit with light sweet earthiness to it.  Very easy drinking and has none of the typical Belgian yeast dominance. I think its very quaffable with its low bitterness.  Its a nice obscure style and I wish I could try more like this.22oz bomber, Rodenbach smaller tulip glass.

Lean dark malts, but not a lot of roast.  Lightly spicy with a little bit of apple sweetness.  Pretty decent brew. 	7 3 7 3 14	Bottle shared by eyedrinkale.  Brownish black with a light brown head.

review/text: Thanks to beastiefan2k for sharing - cloudy dark red beer, with a moderate lacing - aroma of dark fruit, chocolate, spices, some oxidation - there a bit of oxidation in the flavor, too, along with hard to place spices, but the flavor seems focused around this earthy, vegetal quality that I couldnt quite get into - a wee bit of nutty character - the spices become quite warming in the finish - a little thin, but an interesting beer.

review/text: Thanks STFUN for this one. Color was black with a red tint. Smelled of dark fruits and spices. Taste is toffee, small amount of chocolate, and fruits spices. Texture is light, not watery though, with some carbonation.  Like josh said almost a wine beer. Different but good. Thanks again josh.

review/text: Bottle shared by GMCC2181. Pour was brown to black w/ some reddish hues to it too (when tilted). The head was 1cm and had good retention, steady bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was coriander spices, oranges, light yeast, some dark fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation. Fix up the latter, and weve got ourselves a very fine beer here - enjoyable as is, though. Thanks, Gabe, for sharing!

review/text: 22 oz bottle: Pours like coffee, deep black core with dark brown highlights around the rim of the glass.  The head starts healthy, but settles into a skim after a few sips.  The nose really reminds me of a brown ale - notes of toffee, flat caramel and semi-sweet chocolate are abound.  The belgian yeast adds some light, fruity esthers that add an interesting dimension.  The body is chewy with an onslaught of sweet malts.  Notes of caramel and baked brown initially hit the tongue.  The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity.

review/text: Pours near black with ruby hues and a mostly receding tan foamy head. Taste is toffee, light chocolate, phenolic fruits, cherries, and spice. Mouthfeel is medium to full with lush carbonation. I dont know why this is considered a traditional ale, its pretty much a Belgian-style stout, except for the serious shortage of yeast character.

Pretty much taste the same thing.  A little bit of clove flavor as well.  Medium body.  High carbonation.  Dry finish.  Just an okay beer.

review/text: Bottle:  Pours a dark ruby-tinted amber with no head.  Roasted malt, sweet bread dough and some subtle chocolate notes in the nose.  Dry, bread dough flavor which ended up being much sweeter than expected.  Has a nice belgian yeast taste to it.  Not much in the way of body on this but still drinkable.

review/text: Another quality session IPA.  The lowest ABV of any IPA I would buy for regular consumption.  Tasty..but could be improved upon a little bit.  A brand new batch was just made. Im with the guy who thinks Chinook...I love the grapefruit taste in this beer.  Mad Anthony India Pale Ale is 100% Chinook so that might explain why I like Barley quite well.  Ill ask Mike at Barley and report back with reviews on their full line.

review/text: Received in a trade with mmm///beer, so thanks bro.  The beer was quite nice actually, with enough hops to satisfy this West Coast hop head.  No it wasnt a flat out assault on the senses, but subtley has its place and it had a place in this beer.		The beer poured out a clear, medium/dark amber color with a 2-finger light tan head.  Aroma was mostly citrusy, slightly vegetative, a bit astringent, with a light toasted malt angle.  Flavor had notes of citrus, a bit iced tea to it, some minor malt sweetness but the thing that suprised me at how dry it was, which really seemed to amplify the hoppage.  Nice beer!

review/text: Bottle via trade with mmm///beer.  This brew pours a thick, hazy orange with a continual slow bubbling and a modest light head. The aroma is dominated by the hops, grapefruit and a sharp floral scent, with some sweet malt seeping through. The mouth feel is thick and fizzy, tickling the tongue. No definitive malt flavor shines through, but its sweetness adds some balance to the citric, earthy hop bitterness that takes over the taste. Nice bitter finish. Pretty good stuff.

review/text: Pours a transparent bright copper orange with a spotty-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty caramel malts with a touch of resiny, piny hops.  Starts with good fullness and sweet crystal maltiness with a decent balance of piny bittering and flavor hops.  Finishes with nice residual sweetness and a crisp bitterness.  Certainly more on the maltier side of IPAs, but I like it.

review/text: 12 oz. poured into shaker (purchased at Liquor Barn- Louisville, KY)- poured transparent orange/amber color, small off white head formed and quietly bubbled away with some lacing, low carbonation.  Aroma of floral hops, citrus, and malt.  Hits the mouth with a low-medium body, malt comes in at first but quickly transforms into hops that strike the back on the tongue.  Finish has a tendency to drop off, sharply.  Its welcome in my fridge anytime.

review/text: 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a dense beige head.  The aroma is orange citrus, moderately sweet caramel malt, and a touch of pineapple.  The flavor has a good bit of caramel malt to balance the citrusy hop bitterness.  This one shows good balance and judging by the scores is a little underappreciated IMHO.  Smooth and easy to drink with a medium/full body.  A very solid IPA.

review/text: 12oz bottle. Lots of malt, quite possibly lots of caramel malts because it comes off as overly sweet even with the large amount of resiny hops. The hop bitterness is there, but the flavor and aroma contribution seems minimal. Big mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Not the way I like my IPAs.

review/text: Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors, in Granite City, IL. Pours a cloudy copper with two fingers of frothy, ecru head that laces well. The aroma is a slightly musky blend of floral, citric and lightly earthy hops over pale malt. On the light side of medium-bodied, the palate is slightly grainy with a bitter, resinous hop finish. Toasted malt with a solid hit of floral and faint citric hops, it finishes dry and bitter. This is a decent brew, but its certainly not among my favorite IPAs.

The flavor was delicious, however, it clearly is not the flavor of an IPA. I really dont enjoy how it stays on my tounge, it feels coated with bitterness. I was impressed with this beer from the standpoint that it tastes, smells, and looks good. However, it is not quite correct for an IPA. Also, it doesnt sit on my palate well. Overall, a very good beginners IPA.

review/text: Bottle courtesy of Indybigtom: Poured a cloudy orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of bitter dry hops is dominating with some light caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by some dry bitter hops with no floral or citrus notes and some very light caramel malt. Body is quite full with some good carbonation.

review/text: Clear light copper color with a tall lasting ecru head. Pale malt with earthy hops undertones. Some citric hops in the background with a sweeter tint, oranges and rudy red grapefruit. The scents seem a bit thin with no real depth. Lots of citrus flavors with tang and just a hint of butterscotch. Finish is lightly sharp with some pine tar and biting citric pith.LInger has a touch of malt and caramel to help smooth things out. I find this closer to an APA.

review/text: Bottle.  Tinny orange in the nose, fruity, herbal, minty even.  Taste is somewhat clean pils malt but has a vegetal staleness, and hop charachter is mild: mint leaves, navel oranges, lemon, floral flavors, a little bit astringent and sharp at times.  Decent overall.

review/text: Pretty good offering from Barley Island. Not the best IPA Ive ever had, but its different from most of the average ones, which is good. Pours a really nice amber color, with a perfect head. Lots of carbination bubbles. Very piney aroma and flavor, nice balance of citrus, and a little malt mixed in. Bitterness on the back end, with a metallic aftertaste (which I didnt care for). A little too sticky, but a good local brew.

review/text: 12oz bottle courtesy of Acknud. Earthy aroma.  For a beer that touts an intense hop aroma, this one did not deliver.  A bit nutty even.  Very little hop aroma.  Amber and orange color.  Nice fluffy white head that stuck around.  Grassy hop flavor.   Not overally bitter like most American IPAs are. There was an off aftertaste.  I could not put my finger on it.  I would call this an APA not IPA.

review/text: Bottle shared with Hogtown Harry and Blankboy, Harrys bottle.  Odd aroma - some alcohol, some hops, but I dont know - weird.    Dark orange, small white head.  Odd taste - burnt malt, some hops, sweetened tea.  Man, I did not like this one at all. Maybe it was off, but the bottle was fresh enough from one of Harrys recent trades I think.

review/text: Bottle (12oz).  Shared with tupalev, my bottle.  Hazy amber, average frothy off-white head.  Interesting aroma, initially sweet nutmeat or cocoa -then leafy, UK-style hops.  Taste - dont like it at all - sour dishwater is really all I can think of, vague hops, but not good enough to care much.  Average body, sour aftertaste - bleh.

review/text: Bottle purchased at Corral in Granite City, IL. This poured with lots of floaters in the medium amber colored body. A light khaki head was on top. The aroma was basic oranges and bread crust. The taste was some grapefruit and a little bread crust. A nice woody finish. A decent IPA.

review/text: 12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.

review/text: 12 oz. bottle, courtesy of DrMatt - thanks for this midwest IPA!  Pours hazy medium amber with a small whitish head that leaves spotty lace.  Mild aroma primarily of toasty malts and floral hop notes with a hint of orange.  Flavor comes across more strongly, toasty malts again, hints of caramel provide a counterpoint to the floral, piney and grapefruit rind hoppiness, finishing with astringent spicy tingle.  Medium to full body and prickly carbonation.  Quite enjoyable.

Tasted pretty well balanced, with a nice malt profile mixed with a decent hop presence.  The intensity wasnt really there, as it lacked the punch I like.  It was drinkable.

review/text: Bottled.  Poured hazy medium orange with lots of chunky sediment and a short, well-retained cap of off-white head.. nice lacing as it descended.  The aroma picked up orange and other citrusy hoppage along with floral notes and some biscuity malts.. more-or-less malt-based and intriguing with the combination of elements.  The flavor had a sweet, tacky caramel base that was rum (or more accurately some other raw booze) accented.. mild to moderate bitterness of the citrus variety.. pine notes on the finish.. a bit rough all-around.  Medium-bodied and too sharp at several points on the palate.. could have perhaps used more hoppage to help the balance.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker.  This beer poured a dark brownish copper color with a foamy beige head that slowly faded.  Some uneven, sticky lace was left around the glass.  The aroma consisted of a big citrus/grapefruit presence followed up by a nice caramel malt backbone.  The flavor was super hoppy, with sweet grapefruit flavors giving way to the roasted caramel, and finishing just slightly bitter.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation.  This is an excellent brew, done in the same vein as Alpha King.  Very tasty, and vastly underappreciated.

review/text: Pours a beautiful orange amber with a one inch off-white head. Aroma is a great balance of floral/herbal, citrus hops with a touch of caramal malt. Not as strong as it could be. Flavor is surprisingly balanced--great floral front hop (slight grapefruit--not too much), a complex nutty, caramel malt background, followed by a moderate bittering finish.  Not too bitter; not too sweet. Mouthfeel, for this size beer, is has a pleasant unexpected stickyness. I concur with many that this makes a great session IPA in an age of big beers.

Aroma has a nice balance of citrus and pine hops and sweet malt. Simple flavour of hops and caramel malt, a bit of fruit and a quick bitter finish -- easy to drink and refreshing. Medium bodied.

review/text: Hazy copper pour with foamy off-white head. The beer looks thick and feels thick and has a decent balance between bittering hops and sweet malts. Citrus aromas of grapefruit with notes of pine and flowers. Some caramel in the background. The flavor is moderately bitter and lightly sweet. Thick mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finish is bitter. A bit too full-bodied for my taste in an IPA, but certainly ejoyable enough nonetheless.

review/text: Nice IPA I got from my Secret Santa. Thanks man! Aroma was kind of weak but what was there was all hops. Pour was a beautiful dark burnt orange with a nice 1 finger off white head. Taste was mostly citrus hops with a little malt in the background, but this is definately a hops oriented IPA. Not too strong or overbearing however, just a good sessionable IPA which is rare nowadays.

A bit of vanilla sweet malt in the mouth, with the grapefruit-orange hop elements showing up mid-sip. Theres a nice black pepper bitterness on the back finish, which sharpens up the mouthfeel nicely. Could use a bit more hop presence on the nose, but a pretty good IPA otherwise.

review/text: Pour is amber orange with a somewhat thick head for the style.  Aroma is vegetal, herbs, and some grapefruit hops.  Flavor is more on the malty side with some bitterness in the finish.  Not the smoothest IPA, but then again, most IPAs arent supposed to be smooth.  Very average within its class, which makes sense given its style pct.   Kind of an interesting side note.  My wife picked a 6 pack of this up thinking my friend liked IPAs.  I told her that one of the few styles my buddy didnt care for were IPAs (which meant score more for me).  Yey!
